geoserver
=========

GeoServer and GeoAgent is a software to monitor current location of company mobiles and tablets. The intention of the project was to bring the new feature to a scheduling software - a geoscheduling. The GeoServer (for Linux/UNIX and Windows, written in Java) can schedule jobs (including the tasks in the scheduling software like BMC Control-M) on a basis of the position of the GeoAgent(s) (the mobile part for Android, written in C++ and Java).
